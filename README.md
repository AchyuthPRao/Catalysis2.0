##### If you want to work on any component you have to request to work on the issue and it will be assigned.

The basic set up of the website is done. Use tailwind css for styling the website.
Fork and add a star to the repo.

Some important pointers:
- You don't necessarily have to stick to the exact design given. You're free to experiment with whatever looks better (but stick to the provided theme).
- Most of our users will use a mobile for registration, so try to make the screen view as clean as possible.
- Try to practice proper Agile methodology as it will be helpful in the future.
- Try not to make too many commits. Make a commit only when necessary and open a pull request (PR).
- All the content will be checked by seniors, and based on their feedback, the PRs will be accepted.
- If there are any suggested changes, try to implement them as suggested.
- If you have any doubts, you can reach out to us.
